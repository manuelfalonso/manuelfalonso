# VFX PropertySO Management with Scriptable Objects

- **Scriptable Object-Based VFX Control**: Utilize ScriptableObjects to manage and control various VFX elements like `BlendShapes`, `MaterialPropertyBlock`, and `Material` in Unity.
- **BlendShapes**: Control mesh deformations through blend shapes, allowing for dynamic and procedural visual effects.
- **MaterialPropertyBlock**: Use `MaterialPropertyBlock` to modify material properties at runtime, such as colors, textures, or shaders, without altering the original material.
- **Material Scripting API**: Interface with Unityâ€™s Material API to manipulate and manage materials efficiently during gameplay.

## When to Use It

- When you want to centralize and manage your VFX logic in reusable ScriptableObject assets.
- For large projects where VFX behaviors are complex and need to be managed across multiple objects or scenes without cluttering individual GameObjects.

## When Not to Use It

- If VFX behaviors need to be very specific to a single object or require frequent, unique modifications based on gameplay.
