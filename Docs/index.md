## About Me

I am a Unity Developer with a passion for creating scalable and reusable code. My experience spans across VR game development, mobile optimization, and implementing complex systems in Unity. This repository reflects my journey in game development and my desire to share useful tools with the Unity community.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: All scripts are developed using [Unity](https://unity.com/), leveraging both C# scripting and the Unity Engine.
- **Docfx**: Documentation for the repository is generated using [Docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/), providing detailed explanations and guides for each script. You can visit the [documentation site here](https://manuelfalonso.github.io/manuelfalonso/).
