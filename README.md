## Key Features

This repository includes a variety of features designed to enhance Unity development. Below are some of the key features:

### 1. Prefab Instantiation Management with Scriptable Objects

- **Scriptable Object-Based Instantiation**: This system allows you to manage the instantiation of prefabs using ScriptableObjects, promoting clean, decoupled code.
- **`RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod` Integration**: Prefabs are instantiated at runtime using the `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod` attribute, providing flexibility for initialization before or after scene loading.
- **Support for `RuntimeInitializeLoadType`**: Each instantiation can be configured to initialize at different points in the application lifecycle by managing the `RuntimeInitializeLoadType`, such as:
  - **BeforeSceneLoad**: Initialize prefabs before any scene is loaded.
  - **AfterSceneLoad**: Initialize prefabs after the first scene is loaded.
  - **AfterAssembliesLoaded**: Run instantiation after the assemblies are loaded.

#### When to Use It

- When you need to automatically instantiate essential objects (e.g., managers, global controllers) during game loading or when entering Play Mode, ensuring consistency across all scenes.
- For large projects where you want to centralize and simplify scene setup by ensuring base objects are always present without manual intervention.

#### When Not to Use It

- If the prefab needs to be instantiated on-demand based on user interactions (e.g., spawning enemies or items during gameplay).
- When prefabs need to be instantiated with specific runtime data that cannot be pre-configured in a ScriptableObject.

### 2. Strategy Pattern Implementation with ScriptableObjects

- **Generic Strategy Interface (`IStrategy<T>`)**: A reusable, type-safe interface that defines an `Execute(T context)` method, enabling flexible behavior definition across various systems.
- **ScriptableObject-Based Strategies**: Each strategy is implemented as a `ScriptableObject`, allowing you to create, reuse, and edit behaviors directly in the Unity Editor without modifying code.
- **`MultiStrategy` Composition**: Compose multiple strategies into a single `MultiStrategySO`, which executes each sub-strategy sequentially, enabling modular and scalable behavior trees or action stacks.
- **Plug-and-Play Architecture**: Integrate new behaviors at runtime or in the editor simply by creating new `StrategySO` assets and assigning them to MonoBehaviours or systems that consume `IStrategy<T>`.

#### When to Use It

- When designing AI, abilities, event responses, or any modular behavior that benefits from separation of concerns and reuse.
- When you want to empower designers or non-programmers to configure behaviors in the Unity Editor without writing code.
- In projects that require easily testable and swappable logic components following the open/closed principle.

#### When Not to Use It

- For performance-critical operations where `ScriptableObject` indirection might introduce unnecessary overhead.
- When behavior logic is tightly coupled to runtime data or state that cannot be serialized or injected into a stateless strategy context.

### 3. Enum Flags Utility Extensions

- **Bitwise Operation Helpers**: Provides clean, readable extension methods to work with `[Flags]` enums in C#, such as `HasFlagFast`, `AddFlag`, and `RemoveFlag`.
- **Improved Readability**: Eliminates verbose bitwise logic in your code, making conditionals involving enum flags much easier to read and maintain.
- **Safe and Generic**: Fully generic implementation that ensures type safety across all enum flag operations using constraints.

#### Example Usage

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum UnitState
{
    None = 0,
    Idle = 1 << 0,
    Moving = 1 << 1,
    Attacking = 1 << 2
}

// Combine flags
UnitState state = UnitState.Idle | UnitState.Moving;

// Check flag
bool isMoving = state.HasFlagFast(UnitState.Moving);

// Remove a flag
state = state.RemoveFlag(UnitState.Idle);

// Add a flag
state = state.AddFlag(UnitState.Attacking);
```

#### When to Use It

- When using [Flags] enums to represent combinations of states, permissions, toggles, or modifiers.
- In systems where flag manipulation is frequent and needs to remain concise and highly readable (e.g., state machines, ability systems, UI settings, etc).

#### When Not to Use It

- If you're not using [Flags] enums, or if your enum represents mutually exclusive values.
- In highly performance-critical sections where even the minimal overhead of an extension method might be a concern (though in most cases it's negligible).

### 4. Extensible ScriptableObject Observer Pattern (Generic Event System)

- **ScriptableObject-Based Event Dispatching**: A highly reusable observer pattern using `ScriptableObject` assets as event channels. Events are defined as generic base classes, supporting payloads or parameterless types.
- **Generic and Extensible**: The system is fully generic, enabling you to create type-safe event assets with payloads (e.g., `GameEvent<T>`) or without (e.g., `VoidEvent`). This makes it easy to scale across multiple event types without duplicating logic.
- **Runtime Listener Support**: Includes MonoBehaviour-based `EventListener<T>` and `VoidEventListener` scripts that register/unregister with the corresponding `ScriptableObject` events automatically during the objectâ€™s lifecycle.
- **Editor Tooling Included**: Custom editor drawers and inspectors show live subscribers at runtime, allowing quick debugging and better insight into event flow across your project.

#### When to Use It

- For decoupling game systems like UI, audio, input, and gameplay logic using event-driven architecture.
- In projects where designers or non-programmers need to connect logic via the Inspector without tight coupling.
- When you want a centralized, editor-visible, and testable alternative to UnityEvents or C# delegates.

#### When Not to Use It

- If your project doesn't benefit from decoupling or is too small to justify the abstraction.
- In performance-critical inner loops where event overhead could introduce latency (e.g., physics step logic).

### 5. Scene Management via ScriptableObject Strategies

- **Decoupled Scene Loading Logic**: This system replaces tightly coupled scene-loading code with flexible ScriptableObject strategies, enabling reusable and testable scene operations.
- **Strategy Pattern Architecture**: Each scene-related behavior (load, unload, reload, set active, etc.) is encapsulated within a dedicated `SceneStrategySO`, following the Strategy pattern. These behaviors are pluggable and composable at runtime.
- **Support for Multi-Strategy Composition**: Complex loading sequences can be created by composing multiple strategies via `MultiSceneStrategySO`, allowing for chainable and layered scene logic (e.g., load multiple scenes additively, then set one active).
- **Asset-Driven Design for Reusability**: Scene strategies are defined as assets, allowing designers or developers to reuse and reference them directly in other systems like gameplay logic, UI buttons, or startup sequences without code changes.
- **Lifecycle Awareness and Delayed Execution**: Strategies support integration with Unityâ€™s coroutine system for asynchronous loading, and can be configured to delay, wait for conditions, or execute in order.

#### When to Use It

- In large or modular projects where scene loading behaviors need to be reused across multiple contexts (e.g., level management, transitions, UI-driven flows).
- When you want to enable designers to configure and tweak scene logic without code intervention.
- For tools, prototypes, or frameworks that require flexible, data-driven scene control.

#### When Not to Use It

- For simple or one-off scene transitions where the overhead of asset creation and modular logic isnâ€™t justified.
- If you need tight control over scene loading lifecycles in performance-critical code, where monolithic logic might be more efficient.

### 6. Asset and Reference Search Tool (Editor-Only)

- **Advanced Search Utility for Assets and Components**: This custom Editor tool enables deep and flexible search operations across your Unity project, including assets, components in scenes, and serialized references.
- **Supports Asset and Scene Queries**: It can locate assets by type, name, and path, and also search scenes for components and fields that reference specific objects or types.
- **Reference Search Functionality**: Built-in tools allow you to trace serialized references to specific ScriptableObjects, prefabs, or MonoBehavioursâ€”ideal for refactoring and debugging.
- **Modular Search Architecture**: The tool is organized into modular search strategies, allowing extension and customization to fit your studio or projectâ€™s asset workflow.
- **Context Menu Integration**: Many of the search utilities can be triggered via the Unity context menu, enabling fast one-click investigation from the Project or Hierarchy views.

#### When to Use It

- When cleaning up unused assets or determining the impact of removing a ScriptableObject or prefab.
- During refactors to track all references to a given type or instance.
- For debugging unexpected behaviors linked to misplaced or redundant references in scenes or prefabs.

#### When Not to Use It

- If you're looking for runtime search or tracking (this tool is strictly Editor-only).
- In very small projects where reference tracing can be managed manually.

### 7. Coroutine Management Utilities

- **Centralized Coroutine Handling via Static Class**: Provides a global, static entry point to start and stop coroutines without requiring a MonoBehaviour reference.
- **Persistent Coroutine Runner**: A hidden, automatically created `MonoBehaviour` instance is used internally to run coroutines safely from any context.
- **Safe Coroutine Lifecycle**: Ensures coroutines persist correctly through scene loads (if desired) and avoids common pitfalls with manually-managed runners or singletons.
- **Simplified API for Non-MonoBehaviour Scripts**: Greatly improves ergonomics when triggering coroutines from ScriptableObjects, static methods, or services without tight coupling to GameObjects.

#### When to Use It

- When you want to decouple coroutine execution from scene objects or lifetime-bound MonoBehaviours.
- In utility libraries, service locators, or ScriptableObject systems where coroutine support is required.

#### When Not to Use It

- In cases where you need more complex coroutine scheduling or time-slicing, such as a job system or task queue.

### 8. Lerp Utilities for Smooth Transitions

- **Generic Lerp Utility Functions**: Provides reusable linear interpolation (`Lerp`) and unclamped interpolation methods for various data types like `float`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, and `Color`.
- **Ease of Use in Gameplay and UI Code**: Enables smooth transitions without the boilerplate, helping with animations, UI effects, camera movement, fading, or value blending.
- **Custom Extension Methods**: Includes intuitive and readable extension methods for applying interpolation directly on supported types, increasing code clarity.
- **Support for Fixed and Delta Time**: Offers overloads for both unscaled and delta time, ensuring smooth performance regardless of framerate or time scaling.

#### When to Use It

- When you need to implement smooth transitions over time for values, visuals, or game logic.
- For improving the readability and maintainability of any codebase with frequent interpolation needs.

#### When Not to Use It

- For highly complex animations or easing that require tweening libraries.
- If transitions depend on physics-based motion or require precise physical accuracy.

### 9. Unity Message Forwarding for Decoupled Callbacks

- **Unity Lifecycle Event Forwarders**: Contains MonoBehaviour scripts like `UnityInitializationMessagesHandler`, `UnityDecommissioningMessagesHandler`, `UnityOnMouseMessagesHandler`, `UnityPhysicsCollisionMessagesHandler`, and `UnityPhysicsTriggerMessagesHandler` that expose Unityâ€™s internal lifecycle messages through public C# events.
- **UnityEvent-Based Architecture**: Each script defines one or more `UnityEvent` delegates that external components can subscribe to, enabling decoupled logic execution tied to specific Unity lifecycle events.
- **Minimal and Reusable**: Designed to be lightweight components that can be attached to any GameObject to broadcast Unity messages without subclassing MonoBehaviour.

#### When to Use It

- When you want to connect Unity lifecycle events (like `Awake` or `Update`) to external systems without inheriting or modifying MonoBehaviour scripts.
- For rapid prototyping where you need quick lifecycle event hooks in modular components.
- To trigger effects, behaviors, or custom logic in a decoupled and testable way.

#### When Not to Use It

- If your project architecture already favors centralized lifecycle handling (e.g., via managers or script execution order).
- When directly writing behavior inside MonoBehaviour methods is simpler and clearer.

### 10. VFX PropertySO Management with Scriptable Objects

- **Scriptable Object-Based VFX Control**: Utilize ScriptableObjects to manage and control various VFX elements like `BlendShapes`, `MaterialPropertyBlock`, and `Material` in Unity.
- **BlendShapes**: Control mesh deformations through blend shapes, allowing for dynamic and procedural visual effects.
- **MaterialPropertyBlock**: Use `MaterialPropertyBlock` to modify material properties at runtime, such as colors, textures, or shaders, without altering the original material.
- **Material Scripting API**: Interface with Unityâ€™s Material API to manipulate and manage materials efficiently during gameplay.

#### When to Use It

- When you want to centralize and manage your VFX logic in reusable ScriptableObject assets.
- For large projects where VFX behaviors are complex and need to be managed across multiple objects or scenes without cluttering individual GameObjects.

#### When Not to Use It

- If VFX behaviors need to be very specific to a single object or require frequent, unique modifications based on gameplay.
